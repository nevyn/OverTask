OverTask
================

OverTask is for keeping track of a short-term hierarchical todo while you code, as an overlay over your entire screen.

Each task is a block, in a tree going upwards from the bottom of the screen. Arrow keys navigate; pressing up or sideways while at an edge creates child and sibling nodes, respectively. Space or backspace completes a task. Return edits the name of the task. See the Help menu for additional shortcuts.

Any of these shortcuts work globally in whatever app you're working from, if you combine them with command and control.

While holding command and control, you can move the mouse cursor up or down to change the overall opacity of OverTask.
